%Comments: Li et al. proposed a two-phase model for learning rules from incomplete data. In the first phase, rules and partial rules are induced based on non-missing values. In the second phase, partial rules are modified and refined by the imputation of some missing values, so that the performance of the rules may improve.

%Comments: Li et al. proposed an innovative method of inducing rules from incomplete data using an interval set model. They use interval set to represent the partially known or uncertain concepts in an incomplete information table. Upper and lower bounds of the extension of a partially known concepts are presented using interval sets, and the relationships between two concepts are induced based on interval inclusion relations including certain inclusion, possible inclusion and weak inclusion.

%Comments: Li et al. presented a comparative analysis on the monotonicity of the positive region in PRS and DTRS, and concluded that the positive region in DTRS does not obey the monotonicity w.r.t. attributes.
